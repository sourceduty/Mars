For establishing Martian habitats (habs), regions near water ice deposits will be ideal. Subsurface ice is crucial for long-term missions, as it could support human consumption, agricultural activities, and fuel production. The Utopia Planitia is another candidate, given its suspected reserves of water ice and relatively smooth plains. Choosing areas like these, with stable terrain and accessible resources, would significantly ease the challenges of sustaining human life, as well as reduce the need for importing water from Earth.

Safety and environmental conditions are also essential considerations for hab locations. Shielding from solar radiation is vital, given Mars' thin atmosphere, so areas with natural formations like lava tubes or cliffs, where habitats could be shielded or partially buried, would be beneficial. Additionally, regions close to the Martian equator would offer milder temperature fluctuations, which can help maintain the habs' structural integrity and simplify temperature control inside living quarters. The large canyon system Valles Marineris is another region of interest, as its steep walls could offer natural protection from radiation.

For SpaceX and other agencies, accessible locations with clear scientific and practical advantages will shape the selection of landing and habitation sites. As more data is collected on Martian terrain and resource availability, plans will become more refined. Using advanced technology, like real-time hazard detection and adaptive landing systems, will make it possible to explore and settle regions that were previously too risky for exploration. These considerations ensure that early human missions to Mars can establish a sustainable presence and build a foundation for future exploration.
