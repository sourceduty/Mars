## Rover Design

### Standardization

Alex: "I'm very surprised that all of the rovers on Mars aren't standardized and easy to disassemble for reuse. I think that the unique design of each Martian rover seems inefficient as designed by humans who practice standardization on Earth."

### Design for Salvage-Capable Rovers in Space Exploration

Designing a rover capable of salvaging previous rovers is notably more expensive than creating a standard rover. The increased cost stems from the complexity of the technology, requiring advanced robotics, sensors, and specialized tools. Extensive research and development efforts, including customization for specific missions and target rovers, contribute to the higher expenses. Rigorous testing, integration, redundancy, and potential human involvement further elevate the overall cost.

Despite the greater upfront investment, the benefits of resource recovery and sustainability in future missions may justify these expenses. Salvage rovers have the potential to recycle valuable materials and components, reducing the need for new resources and minimizing waste. The decision to develop a salvage-capable rover should be carefully weighed against the associated costs and mission objectives to determine its feasibility and value.

## Martian Lightsabers

The primary mission of Mars 2020 rover involves meticulously collecting Mars rocks and soil, sealing them in tubes, and depositing them at specific surface locations with precise maps for potential future retrieval. In the rover's abdomen, essential equipment like a rotating drill carousel and 43 sample tubes are managed by a small robotic arm. To prevent Earth contamination, "witness tubes" accompany sample tubes, capturing potential contaminants. These witness tubes are opened on the Martian surface to monitor the environment during sample collection. Once collected, samples are stored within the rover until they are strategically placed at designated "sample cache depots" with precise coordinates, allowing for future retrieval and potential return to Earth, ensuring contamination-free Martian material study.

## Rover Recovery 

### Concept Mission

Consider the landing sites of the major Mars rover missions: Sojourner (part of the Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997), Spirit and Opportunity (Mars Exploration Rovers, landed in 2004), and Curiosity (Mars Science Laboratory, landed in 2012).

Here are the approximate landing coordinates for each rover:

- Sojourner (Mars Pathfinder): 19.13°N, 33.22°W (Ares Vallis)
- Spirit (MER-A): 14.5684°S, 175.472636°E (Gusev Crater)
- Opportunity (MER-B): 1.9462°S, 354.4734°E (Meridiani Planum)
- Curiosity (MSL): 4.5895°S, 137.4417°E (Gale Crater)

Using these coordinates, we can calculate the great-circle distances between the rovers. This calculation considers the curvature of Mars, which has an average radius of approximately 3,389.5 km. The great-circle distance is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior).

- Between Sojourner and Spirit: Approximately 9004 km
- Between Sojourner and Opportunity: Approximately 2036 km
- Between Sojourner and Curiosity: Approximately 9633 km
- Between Spirit and Opportunity: Approximately 9670 km
- Between Spirit and Curiosity: Approximately 2292 km
- Between Opportunity and Curiosity: Approximately 8426 km

These distances highlight the vast areas covered by Mars missions and the logistical challenges involved in planning a rover recovery mission, considering the significant distances between each landing site. ​​

### Airborne Concept

A rover recovery mission on Mars, utilizing a helicopter or a modified SkyCrane, would require meticulous planning and innovative engineering solutions. The mission would commence with the deployment of a highly advanced helicopter, designed for the thin Martian atmosphere, or a modified version of the SkyCrane that successfully delivered the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. This aerial vehicle would need to be equipped with state-of-the-art navigation systems, robust power sources, and a versatile grappling mechanism capable of securely attaching to and lifting the varied designs of the target rovers. The recovery route would be strategically planned to minimize travel distance while navigating around Martian terrain features such as craters, canyons, and dust storm-prone areas.

The mission's first phase would focus on the closest rovers, starting with the pair of Opportunity and Spirit, given their relatively close proximity compared to others. The aerial vehicle would navigate to the Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum, secure it, and then proceed to the Gusev Crater to recover Spirit. This phase would test the vehicle's operational capabilities, including its lifting power, endurance, and the efficiency of its grappling mechanism. Subsequent phases would target the more distant rovers, with Sojourner and Curiosity being the next priorities. Special attention would be given to optimizing flight paths to conserve energy, taking advantage of prevailing winds, and ensuring safe landings for rover pick-up and drop-off.

Technological advancements, such as improved battery technology or the utilization of nuclear power sources, would be crucial for the success of this mission. The recovery vehicle would also need to be equipped with autonomous systems for navigation and decision-making, given the communication delay between Earth and Mars. This ambitious mission would not only demonstrate the feasibility of Mars surface asset recovery but also pave the way for future missions involving the recycling of hardware and materials, significantly contributing to the sustainability of long-term exploration efforts on the Red Planet.

### Cost Estimate

Estimating the total cost of a Mars rover recovery mission involving a helicopter or modified SkyCrane is complex and depends on numerous factors including development, manufacturing, testing, and operational aspects. The development of a new aerial vehicle capable of navigating the Martian atmosphere and terrain, equipped with advanced grappling mechanisms and autonomous systems, could easily run into the billions of USD. For context, the Mars Helicopter Ingenuity, a technology demonstrator, cost about $85 million to develop and build, and it is a small, simple rotorcraft compared to what would be needed for a recovery mission.

The modified SkyCrane or helicopter would require significant advancements in propulsion, power, and autonomy technologies. Research, development, and testing of these new systems could increase the mission's cost substantially. Additionally, the cost of launching the mission, which includes the launch vehicle, integration, operations, and mission support, would also be a major component of the total cost. A heavy-lift rocket capable of sending the recovery vehicle to Mars could cost upwards of $150 million to $300 million per launch, depending on the launch provider and the mission's requirements.

Given these considerations, a rough estimate for a Mars rover recovery mission could exceed $1 billion to $3 billion, factoring in the development of the aerial recovery vehicle, launch costs, mission operations, and contingencies. This estimate is speculative and could vary widely based on the mission's final design, the technologies employed, and the extent of the recovery efforts. The mission's unprecedented nature and the technological advancements required would likely place it at the higher end of cost estimates for interplanetary missions.
