## Rover Design

### Standardization

Alex: "I'm very surprised that all of the rovers on Mars aren't standardized and easy to disassemble for reuse. I think that the unique design of each Martian rover seems inefficient as designed by humans who practice standardization on Earth."

### Designing a Salvage Rover: Advanced Requirements for Resource Recycling

Designing a rover with the capability to disassemble a previous rover for salvage entails several key requirements. Firstly, it needs advanced robotic arms with precise control and a variety of specialized end-effectors for delicate component handling. Additionally, it must have advanced sensors, cameras, and navigation algorithms to accurately identify, approach, and assess the target rover. The disassembly rover should also possess a versatile toolset, secure material handling, and efficient communication systems to carry out the salvage process effectively and report progress to mission control.

Moreover, safety protocols, redundant systems, and resource-efficient algorithms are vital to ensure the rover's reliability and minimize the risk of accidents. Compatibility with the target rover's design, environmental considerations to prevent contamination, and human supervision capabilities for critical decision-making are essential aspects. Overall, this rover would serve as a valuable asset in future exploration missions, promoting sustainability by reusing resources and components from decommissioned rovers.
