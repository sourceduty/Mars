## Rover Design

### Standardization

Alex: "I'm very surprised that all of the rovers on Mars aren't standardized and easy to disassemble for reuse. I think that the unique design of each Martian rover seems inefficient as designed by humans who practice standardization on Earth."

### Design for Salvage-Capable Rovers in Space Exploration

Designing a rover capable of salvaging previous rovers is notably more expensive than creating a standard rover. The increased cost stems from the complexity of the technology, requiring advanced robotics, sensors, and specialized tools. Extensive research and development efforts, including customization for specific missions and target rovers, contribute to the higher expenses. Rigorous testing, integration, redundancy, and potential human involvement further elevate the overall cost.

Despite the greater upfront investment, the benefits of resource recovery and sustainability in future missions may justify these expenses. Salvage rovers have the potential to recycle valuable materials and components, reducing the need for new resources and minimizing waste. The decision to develop a salvage-capable rover should be carefully weighed against the associated costs and mission objectives to determine its feasibility and value.

## Martian Lightsabers

The [dirt sample tubes](https://www.space.com/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-sample-tubes-lightsabers) dropped from the Mars 2020 rover look like lightsabers.

The primary mission of Mars 2020 rover involves meticulously collecting Mars rocks and soil, sealing them in tubes, and depositing them at specific surface locations with precise maps for potential future retrieval. In the rover's abdomen, essential equipment like a rotating drill carousel and 43 sample tubes are managed by a small robotic arm. To prevent Earth contamination, "witness tubes" accompany sample tubes, capturing potential contaminants. These witness tubes are opened on the Martian surface to monitor the environment during sample collection. Once collected, samples are stored within the rover until they are strategically placed at designated "sample cache depots" with precise coordinates, allowing for future retrieval and potential return to Earth, ensuring contamination-free Martian material study.
