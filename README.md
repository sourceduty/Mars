## Rover Design

### Standardization

Alex: "I'm very surprised that all of the rovers on Mars aren't standardized and easy to disassemble for reuse. I think that the unique design of each Martian rover seems inefficient as designed by humans who practice standardization on Earth."

### Designing a Salvage Rover

Designing a rover with the capability to disassemble a previous rover for salvage entails several key requirements. Firstly, it needs advanced robotic arms with precise control and a variety of specialized end-effectors for delicate component handling. Additionally, it must have advanced sensors, cameras, and navigation algorithms to accurately identify, approach, and assess the target rover. The disassembly rover should also possess a versatile toolset, secure material handling, and efficient communication systems to carry out the salvage process effectively and report progress to mission control.

Moreover, safety protocols, redundant systems, and resource-efficient algorithms are vital to ensure the rover's reliability and minimize the risk of accidents. Compatibility with the target rover's design, environmental considerations to prevent contamination, and human supervision capabilities for critical decision-making are essential aspects. Overall, this rover would serve as a valuable asset in future exploration missions, promoting sustainability by reusing resources and components from decommissioned rovers.

### Design for Salvage-Capable Rovers in Space Exploration

Designing a rover capable of salvaging previous rovers is notably more expensive than creating a standard rover. The increased cost stems from the complexity of the technology, requiring advanced robotics, sensors, and specialized tools. Extensive research and development efforts, including customization for specific missions and target rovers, contribute to the higher expenses. Rigorous testing, integration, redundancy, and potential human involvement further elevate the overall cost.

Despite the greater upfront investment, the benefits of resource recovery and sustainability in future missions may justify these expenses. Salvage rovers have the potential to recycle valuable materials and components, reducing the need for new resources and minimizing waste. The decision to develop a salvage-capable rover should be carefully weighed against the associated costs and mission objectives to determine its feasibility and value.
