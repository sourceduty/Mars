To determine landing spots on Mars for rockets and rovers, NASA and other space agencies consider factors like scientific value, surface safety, accessibility, and potential for future exploration. The primary objective often shapes the choice: for science-focused missions, such as the Mars rovers, regions with significant geological diversity, ancient water flow indicators, or unique mineralogy are prioritized. For example, NASA's Curiosity rover landed in Gale Crater due to the presence of layered sedimentary rocks, which can preserve a record of past environmental conditions, including potential ancient water bodies. Engineers simulate Mars' conditions, conduct risk assessments of terrain features, and rely on high-resolution imagery from orbiters like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to meticulously analyze potential sites.

Surface safety is a critical factor. The landing area must be relatively flat and free of large boulders, cliffs, and other hazards that could endanger the spacecraft. For instance, NASA’s Perseverance rover landed in Jezero Crater, a challenging yet scientifically promising site. To handle the crater's rugged terrain, NASA equipped Perseverance with a new "Terrain Relative Navigation" (TRN) system, which allows the rover to navigate hazards autonomously. This site was chosen despite its risks due to signs of an ancient river delta, which is an ideal spot for looking for biosignatures. This navigation system was crucial, as it enabled precise landing amidst potentially treacherous landscapes that would be off-limits to rovers with less sophisticated landing technologies.

Additionally, agencies evaluate accessibility to sunlight and communication capabilities. For example, solar-powered missions, like the Mars Pathfinder, needed sunny landing sites near the Martian equator to maximize energy absorption. In contrast, NASA’s InSight mission landed at Elysium Planitia, a flat plain close to the equator, which was favorable for its stationary scientific instruments. The landing site selection process combines various high-resolution mapping tools, remote sensing technologies, and simulations to ensure the safe deployment of scientific instruments and data relay capabilities between the lander and Earth. This multidisciplinary approach is essential for understanding both the landing environment and the broader implications of site choice on mission success.

For SpaceX's Starship missions to Mars, likely landing sites will consider a balance of surface safety, proximity to essential resources like water ice, and favorable solar conditions for energy production. Based on current research and speculation, locations in the mid-latitudes, like the Arcadia Planitia, are considered promising. Arcadia Planitia has flat plains and evidence of subsurface ice, which could provide a valuable water source for producing oxygen and fuel. Its relatively mild terrain and potential accessibility to resources align with SpaceX’s goal of establishing a sustainable human presence on Mars.
